Tasks
0. New node
mandatory
Write a function that creates a binary tree node

And value is the value to store in the new node
Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node.

2. Insert right
Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node

Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_right(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
Where parent is a pointer to the node to insert the right-child in
And value is the value to store in the new node
Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
If parent already has a right-child, the new node must take its place, and the old right-child must be set as the right-child of the new node.

3. Delete

Prototype: void binary_tree_delete(binary_tree_t *tree);
Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to delete
If tree is NULL, do nothing

4. Is leaf
Write a function that checks if a node is a leaf

Prototype: int binary_tree_is_leaf(const binary_tree_t *node);

If node is NULL, return 0

6. Pre-order traversal
Write a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal

Prototype: void binary_tree_preorder(const binary_tree_t *tree, void (*func)(int));
Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to traverse
And func is a pointer to a function to call for each node. The value in the node must be passed as a parameter to this function.
If tree or func is NULL, do nothing

7. In-order traversal
Write a function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal

Prototype: void binary_tree_inorder(const binary_tree_t *tree, void (*func)(int));
Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to traverse
And func is a pointer to a function to call for each node. The value in the node must be passed as a parameter to this function.
If tree or func is NULL, do nothing

8. Post-order traversal
Write a function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal

Prototype: void binary_tree_postorder(const binary_tree_t *tree, void (*func)(int));
Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to traverse
And func is a pointer to a function to call for each node. The value in the node must be passed as a parameter to this function.
If tree or func is NULL, do nothing

9. Height
Write a function that measures the height of a binary tree

Prototype: size_t binary_tree_height(const binary_tree_t *tree);
Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to measure the height.
If tree is NULL, your function must return 0

10. Depth
Write a function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree

Prototype: size_t binary_tree_depth(const binary_tree_t *tree);
Where tree is a pointer to the node to measure the depth
If tree is NULL, your function must return 0

11. Size
Write a function that measures the size of a binary tree

Prototype: size_t binary_tree_size(const binary_tree_t *tree);
Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to measure the size
If tree is NULL, the function must return 0

12. Leaves
Write a function that counts the leaves in a binary tree

Prototype: size_t binary_tree_leaves(const binary_tree_t *tree);
Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to count the number of leaves
If tree is NULL, the function must return 0
A NULL pointer is not a leaf

13. Nodes
Write a function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree

Prototype: size_t binary_tree_nodes(const binary_tree_t *tree);
Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to count the number of nodes
